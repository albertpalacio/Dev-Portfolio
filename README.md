# Developer Portfolio Site

## Built from scarth using HTML/CSS and a small dose of JS.

The purpose for this built from scrath portfolio site is to be test my CSS and styling skills while building a web application that is beautiful and easy to use.

The main idea was to test myself during this period and be able to build the website from scratch without any Bootstrap or similar frameworks.
